# odin-recipes
This project involves creating a recipe website. The purpose is 
to put into practice the things I've already learnt about HTML.

The website will consist of an index page and will link to some recipes. 

I will demonstrate that I can set-up boilerplate HTML. Use paragraphs, images, absolute & relative links, headings and line breaks.
